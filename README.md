# üì∞ Fake News Detection Model

This project is a machine learning-based system that detects fake news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It classifies news articles as **Fake (1)** or **Real (0)** using a simple yet effective **Logistic Regression** model.

## üìö Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle:

üîó [Fake and Real News Dataset ‚Äì Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news)

It contains the following columns:
- `id`: Unique ID for the news article
- `title`: Title of the article
- `author`: Author of the article
- `text`: Full text of the news article
- `label`: Classification label  
  - `1`: Fake  
  - `0`: Real

## üîß Features

- Uploads dataset via Colab
- Handles missing values
- Preprocesses text (lowercasing, removing punctuation, etc.)
- Vectorizes news using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**
- Trains a **Logistic Regression model** for binary classification
- Evaluates using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report

## ü§ñ Model Used

We used **Logistic Regression**, which is:
- Simple to implement
- Fast to train
- Easy to interpret
- Well-suited for binary classification tasks like detecting fake vs. real news
